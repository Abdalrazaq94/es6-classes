## Literals -> Class

In these exercises you will be presented with 2 object literals.  Your task is to write a class based on these object literals.

There are a bunch of tests for the class (but not for the literals, they're only there to help you understand the challenge).  You'll know your class is correct when all of the tests pass.

Good Luck!
